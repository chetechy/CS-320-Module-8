How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that code, program, or software is functional and secure, developers should use an environment that suggests secure patterns and reinforces security best practices through notifications in the environment. Also, they should choose their programming language and framework based on the needs of the project and their company.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User Needs are requirements that add value to a product, service, or environment for a user. To incorporate user needs into a program we need to engage in a process wherein users understand their problems, processes, goals and preferences. Some examples are Functions, these are the things that a user needs to accomplish. Functionality helps the developers what to develop and what to be implemented. Next is Accessibility, user needs should be collected from users with diverse characteristics and abilities. Last is Features, this connected with functions since it defines as how functions is implemented. Features aren't need but are method for serving needs. 
 
How do I approach designing software?
We do have two approaches in designing software. One is, Bottom-up approach wherein the design starts with the lowest level components and subsystems. By using these components, the next immediate higher level components and subsystems are created or composed. This approach can be used to hide the low-level details of implementation and be merged with top-down technique. Next is, Top-down approach wherein Each system is divided into several subsystems and components. Each of the subsystem is further divided into set of subsystems and components. This process of division facilitates in forming a system hierarchy structure. The main advantage of top down approach is that its strong focus on requirements helps to make a design responsive according to its requirements.
